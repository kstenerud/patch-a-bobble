Forward Note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please, DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE MODIFIED ROMS!!!!  Distribute Patchfiles instead.
There are certain legal implications to distributing program code that has
been modified from the original form.
Don't distribute the datafiles created by Patch-A-Bobble, either.  They
contain the romfiles.

This is why I created the patchfile format, which only saves your changes so
that new bubble bobble levels can pass freely on the net.

Disclaimer:
~~~~~~~~~~
This software comes with no warranties, no guaranties, nothing whatsoever.
Moreover, this is alpha software, which means it is largely untested, which
means it is buggy.  Use at your own risk.
Warning: Do not use this software unless you have a legal right to own and

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS PROGRAM WITH ROMS!!!!!!!!!



What is it:
~~~~~~~~~~
Patch-A-Bobble is a visual level editor for the best game in the world,
Bubble Bobble.
It features a drag 'n drop system for placing monsters and objects, and a
paint mode for setting the platforms, airflows etc.
I've also introduced a bub patchfile system so people can share their custom
bubble bobble levels easily with others.

This program is a win32 application.



Some things to note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of the graphics for Patch-A-Bobble are decoded from the bubble bobble roms
at runtime so that there are no copyright problems.  Basically, this program
will do NOTHING if you don't supply it with roms.



Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Original, unmodofied roms from either Bubble Bobble, Bobble Bobble, or
   Super Bobble Bobble.
2. A PC running win32 (Windows 95, Windows NT, or Windows 3.1 with Win32
   extensions) in at least 640x480, 256 colors.
   For best results, run in at least 800x600 with at least 32K colors.



Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You must have the Bobble Bobble roms to run this program.

Make a directory for Patch-A-Bobble somewhere.  Copy pbobble.exe there.
Run pbobble.exe.  When it complains that it can't find the data files, it
will ask you to point it to some roms for it to copy.  Select a file
in the directory containing those roms.  (It doesn't matter what file you
select.  You just have to do it to satisfy the Win32 file selector.)

NOTE:  You MUST use unmodified roms in this process.


Note: I've tried very hard to cram the whole thing into a window small enough
      to fit on a 640x480 screen.  Nevertheless, you'll get the best results
      on an 800x600 or higher screen in 32768 colors or higher.
      It works in 256 colors, it just doesn't show all the colors all the time.



Patch-A-Bobble's controls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From top to bottom:
        The up-down controls on the top-right and bottom-right of the bubble
        bobble screen change the top and bottom row types.

        The combination edit box and up-down control is the level selector.

        The "Sup" checkbox selects wether you want to view the levels in normal
        mode or in "Super" mode.  NOTE: this control only lets you see what it
        would look like if it were in "Super" mode.  "Super" mode can only be
        enabled from within the game itself.

        The Alien checkbox turns aliens mode on/off (turns all the robot
        monsters into aliens if "Super" mode is not enabled).

        The Palette up-down control lets you select the palette for this level.

        The black box and left-right control displays the current mode you are
        in, and lets you change the monster direction and type.

        The "plus" thingy selects the paint mode (4 directions for airflow and
        the middle to paint solid platform).

        The sliders in the "Speed" box let you control the bubble speed and
        the monster speed.

        The sliders in the "Time Until" box let you control the time until
        monsters break out of their bubbles, how long until "Hurry Up",
        and how long after hurry up until Baron von Blubba appears.
        The time is approximately in seconds, and some of them have an "Off"
        value =)

        The sliders in the "Rate" box let you specify the rate of water,
        fire, and lightning bubbles that come into the screen.  The total of
        all 3 cannot exceed 16.  So if you want to increase one, you may have
        to decrease another.
        Note: In order for this part to have any effect, you have to select a
        top or bottom row type that allows bubbles to flow into the screen.

        The up-down controls in the top and bottom right corner of the Bubble
        Bobble screen control the top and bottom types.

Using Patch-A-Bobble:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Notes on pointer modes:
        There are multiple pointer modes in this program.  The mode the
        pointer is in is indicated by the black square on the top-right of the
        window.  Default mode is indicated by just a black square.
        In any other mode, there will be some graphic there to indicate what
        mode you are in.
        You can return to default mode at any time by pressing the right mouse
        button within the Bubble Bobble screen area.

How to move the points object and the weapon object:
        Every level in Bubble Bobble has a points item (which gives points) and
        a weapon item (which gives some special power).  The points item is
        represented in Patch-A-Bobble by a cake, and the weapon item is
        represented by a blue candy.
        To move either of them, simply left-click on it to pick it up (make
        sure you are in default mode!), move it to the desired location, and
        then left-click again to drop it.
        Note that if you try to drop it in an invalid region, it will drop as
        close to that area as possible.

How to move monsters:
        Same thing as moving points and weapon objects.

How to change monster direction:
        When you have picked up a monster, left-click on the monster's portrait
        in the mode-indicator square to the right of the window. (your mouse
        will return to the normal pointer when you leave the bubble bobble
        screen area, but will change back when you move it back in).
        The monster will change direction.  Now you can put it back down,
        or right-click in the bubble bobble screen area to drop it exactly
        where it was before.

How to change the monster type:
        Pick up a monster and then click on the left/right arrows under the
        mode-indicator square, then either place the monster back down or
        right-click in the bubble bobble screen area to drop it exactly where
        it was before.

How to add monsters:
        Select "Insert" from the monster-ops pulldown menu, then drop the
        monster somewhere by left-clicking.

How to remove monsters:
        Pick up a monster and then select "Remove" from the monster-ops
        pulldown menu.

How to edit drop patterns:
	Method 1: Select from some stock effects from "Drop Pattern" under
	          monster-ops.
	Method 2: Select "Edit Drop Pattern" under monster-ops.
	          This will change the screen edit method to "drop mode" edit.
	          The points item and weapon item will not be shown.
	          When you select a monster, you will only be able to move it
	          horizontally.  The higher up you move the monster, the later
	          it will drop onto the screen.
	          Select "Edit Drop Pattern" again to return to normal edit mode.

Snap to Grid:
        You can make it so that when you place monsters or items down, they
        will snap to a grid matching the edges of the platforms.  Simply
        select "Snap to Grid" from the "Screen Ops" menu.

Make aliens:
        By checking the "Alien" checkbox, all monsters of type 0 (the robot)
        will change to aliens (Note: This only happens in normal mode, not
        "Super" mode).

Notes on platforms and airflow:
        Platforms are the solid ground that bub and bob can walk on.
        Everything else is and airflow, which determines what direction the
        bubbles will travel in.

Painting the screen:
        You can paint your own platforms and airflows by selecting the
        apporpriate direction from the "plus" thing on the top-right of the
        window.
        Select one of the four extremities to paint that direction of airflow,
        or select the middle one to paint platforms.
        Now when you click on the bubble bobble screen you will paint instead!
        Right-click to go back to default mode.
        Note: you can't paint on the top or bottom row of bubble bobble.  This
        part is controlled by the top and bottom type selector controls located
        on the top right and bottom right of the bubble bobble screen.

Look at it without arrows:
        You can view the screen without arrows by selecting "Toggle arrows"
        from the screen-ops menu.  This doesn't turn the airflow off, but
        rather stops Patch-A-Bobble from displaying them so that you can show
        off those beautiful 4-bit graphics to your friends!

Look at it in "Super" mode:
        You can view the screen as the game would show it in "Super" mode by
        checking the "S" checkbox.

Revert to the original screen:
        Select "revert" from the Edit menu to revert the current screen
        back to its original state.

Use multiple buffers:
        Patch-A-Bobble has 2 buffers: A and B.  You can switch between these
        buffers from the Screen Ops menu.
        This is to allow you to load patchfiles into one buffer and copy the
        screens you want to the level you want in your own rom.



Saving your work:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Saving a patchfile:
        Select "Save Patchfile" from the File menu to save a patchfile that
        other people can patch their roms with.
        Please use this method unless you are modifying your own roms for
        your own personal use.

Saving to ROM:
        When you want to try out your new bubble bobble roms, you must save
        them to some buble bobble rom images.

        Obviously, these files must exist in the directory you tell
        Patch-A-Bobble to save to.

        Note: Mame will complain that the checksums don't match anymore.


Setting File Associations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I've added support for file associations, but you'll have to set
	up the filemanager association yourself.
	To do this, select View->Options in a file display window, go to
	file types and define a new type.
	Put in a description, set the extension to .bub
	Add a new action "open" and point it to the pbobble.exe file.
	You can also change the icon in this dialog.
